## Overview UPDATE ME

This project is definitely not Rotten Tomatoes. Nor is it Netflix. Nor is it IMDB. Itâ€™s R A N C I D T O M A T I L L O S. Very different!

_Rancid Tomatillos_ is a [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/) Module 3 paired project. The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic application that leverages an API to receive, and display, movie data. A user can search and filter a long list of movies, as well as view detailed information about a specific movie by clicking on it. To create this application, we leveraged React, React Router, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create the front-end. As we worked, we used Cypress for test-driven development of our application.




## Planning Resources

* [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/JeffShepherd/niche-audience/projects/1)
* [Miro Board - Wireframes](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lI88SmI=/)


## Setup Instructions


Clone down this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone git@github.com:JeffShepherd/niche-audience.git
```

Then install the library dependencies by running:

## Challenges UPDATE ME

* 
* Completing the project in a short time frame while interviewing and dealing with family emergencies
* 
*

## Wins UPDATE ME


* Learning, and leveraging, multiple new technologies in a short amount of time
* Utilizing new features of React Router to solve a challenging navigation issue
* Optimizing performance of the aplication via architecture changes, API data scrubbing, and destructuring of objects
* Ensuring we prioritize our learning over adding more features to this application

## Future Iterations UPDATE ME

* Deploy and use [our own Express app](https://github.com/JeffShepherd/movie-API/tree/main) for the endpoints holding the data we fetch.
* Refactor the application, and our API, to allow a user to favorite a movie, and view their favorites at a later date.
* Refactor `Form` to render two separate components: `Sort` and `Search`.
* Add a link to the details page to display the movie trailer in a modal element.
